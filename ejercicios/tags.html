    <article>
    <header>
      Here we have the navigation links inside nav tags. We decided to put it
      before anything, although it's not pretty without CSS formatting. CSS is
      out of scope for this case, so everything is ok ^^
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="noticia.html">Noticia</a></li>
          <li><a href="recepta.html">Recepta</a></li>
          <li><a href="tabla.html">Tabla</a></li>
          <li><a href="formulario.html">Formulario</a></li>
          <li><a href="css1.html">CSS 1</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
      <h1>Header</h1>
      <p>A header contains introductory content. We can have several, although we
      choose to have only one for the full document in this case.</p>
    </header>
    <h1>Article</h1>
    <p>
    All of this document is inside an article tag. If we work more on the
    writing, we could interpret this full document as a single article
    describing less-known semantic elements. An article should be independent
    from the rest. We could apply article tags to every paragraph, but we
    would be violating the semantic restriction of article. Beware!
    </p>

    <h1>Sample output and variable</h1>
    This is the output when executing my last C++ code. It is represented by
    the tags samp, which represent the sample output of a program.
    <p>
    <samp>Out of bounds access. [Stack-trace follows]</samp>
    </p>

    <p>
    This error was related to bad use of a variable called <var>myid</var> of
    type <em>int[]</em>. myid is surrounded by var tags for indicating it is a
    variable.
    </p>

    <h1>Cite and abbr</h1>
    <p>
      We can read about the above kind of errors in the book <cite>C++ for
      beginners faketitle</cite> by <abbr title="C++ Beginners
      Group">C++BG</abbr>. In this paragraph we have used cite tag for citing
      a boog and abbr tag for defining an abbreviature with it's expansion.
    </p>

    <h1>Definition</h1>
    <p>
      <dfn>C++</dfn> is a multi-paradigm programming language.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last paragraph contains the tag dfn for describing some text. In our
      case, we describe <em>C++</em> with the contents of the last paragraph.
    </p>

    <h1>Sup and subindexes</h1>
    <p>
    Although rendering equations might be hard with HTML, we can try. Let's
    try to work with subscripts and superscripts. For that, let's define two
    points and the distance between them. We will use tags sub and sup several
    times for indicating text above and down the rest of the text.
    </p>
    <p>
      Point A: p<sub>0</sub> = (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>)
      <br>Point B: p<sub>1</sub> = (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>)
      <br>dist(A,B)=((x<sub>0</sub>-x<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> +
                     (y<sub>0</sub>-y<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup>)
                    <sup>1/2</sup>
    </p>

    <h1>br, hr</h1>
    br tag is a line break. There are several line breaks in this
    document. The next sections will be separated by hr. It is rendered as an
    horizontal line by default. However, the semantic information is more
    interesting: hr indicates a thematic break. Thus, we are supposed to talk
    about something else after hr tag in next source line.
    <hr>

    <h1>aside</h1>
    <aside>
      I haven't discovered any useful usage for aside without CSS for placing
      it as a sidebar
      </aside>

    <h1>Address inside a footer</h1>
    Address displays contact information for the author or owner. It is
    displayed in the footer, just down here. The footer is part of the
    article. However, we could make the footer part of any element: in any case,
    it contains information related to it's parent.
    <footer>
      <address>
      Europe, Spain, Catalonia, Barcelona. C/Street

      <br>This is the address
      </address>
    </footer>
    </article>
  </body>
</html>
