    <p>
    On Sunday morning <em>SpaceX's</em> launch failed again.
    </p>

    <p>
    On Sunday morning it tried and failed to retrieve one of its <mark>Falconf 9</mark>
    rockets, the CRS-7, after a launch, which would have made it the first
    reusable rocket ever. <br> But just <strong>a few minutes</strong> after takeoff, two
    minutes and 14 seconds to be precise, <span>the rocket exploded into tons of
    pieces</span>. It was traveling about 1 kilometer per second at an altitude of 40
    kilometers.
